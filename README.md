These are companion notes to my [dotfiles](https://github.com/rsapkf/config) and [links](https://github.com/rsapkf/42/) where I keep short snippets of code, shell scripts, tricks and tips related to common Linux utilities/concepts, mathematical topics, Martin Gardner's mathemagic tricks, poems that I like, notes from books I've read, etc.

Notes are in the [`docs/`](https://github.com/rsapkf/73/tree/main/docs) directory.
